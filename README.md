# To-do-list-app

Steps to create the project:

1.Open a new Python file in your favorite text editor or IDE.

2.Define a class Task with attributes such as title, description, and status.

3.Define a class ToDoList with methods such as add_task(), delete_task(), view_tasks(), save_tasks(), and load_tasks().

4.Implement the logic for adding a new task to the to-do list, deleting a task from the to-do list, and viewing the current list of tasks.

5.Implement the logic for saving the list of tasks to a file and loading it back again later.

6.Test the app by running the Python file in your terminal or console.
